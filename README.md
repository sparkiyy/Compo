  </p>
</div>

> [!CAUTION]
> Compo is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. Please **DO NOT** use it in production, as breaking changes may occur at any time.

## Installation üì¶
You can install Compo via Wally or by downloading the [.rbxm]("https://github.com/sparkiyy/Compo/releases") file:

```toml
compo = "sparkiyy/compo@VERSION"
```

And you can get Compo Inspector via [Roblox Marketplace](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/94811734793830/Compo-Inspector) or [Releases page ](https://github.com/sparkiyy/Compo/releases)

## Introduction üëæ
In many Roblox games, you'll often find dozens of nearly identical scripts scattered across different instances. For example, many _kill parts_ might each have their own `Touched` script.

While that might be manageable in a small game, it quickly becomes a **nightmare** as your project grows. Want to tweak the behavior? You‚Äôll need to update each script manually ‚Äî which leads to duplication, inconsistencies, and a messy workflow.

That‚Äôs where **Compo** comes in. 

It introduces a component-based approach, heavily inspired by Unity's `MonoBehaviour` system. Instead of attaching full scripts to every object, you write clean, reusable components and assign them to multiple instances ‚Äî modular, scalable, and way easier to maintain.

### üëª Inspector

At the core of the system is Compo Inspector ‚Äî a required plugin that connects your components to the runtime environment.

It automatically detects all modules ending with the `.component` suffix and lets you assign them to instances through the inspector window. You can also expose `fields` in your components to customize behavior per instance 

<img alt="Compo Inspector interface, showing an instance with 0 components" src="assets/compoInspectorMainWindow.png" height="400"/> 

These `fields` are stored as attributes on the instance, using a special naming convention that Compo recognizes at runtime. While it's technically possible to set them manually like this...

```lua
instance:SetAttribute("_component_field" .. COMPONENT_ID .. FIELD_NAME, value)
```
...doing so defeats the purpose of using Compo. You‚Äôd be skipping validation, editor integration, and the ease-of-use that Compo Inspector provides. It takes care of all the tedious setup so your components are consistent, safe, and ready to go.

---
## Getting Started üêº
Components are created using the `.component` suffix. This tells the plugin to register the component and show it in the inspector.

Currently, components can **only** be descendants of the following two realms:

* StarterPlayerScripts
* ServerScriptService

```lua
-- myAwesomeComponent.component.luau
local Compo = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.compo)

return Compo.createComponent(function(component)
    function component.start()
        print("Hello world c:, from: " .. component.instance.Name)   
    end

    function component.onDestroy()
        print("Goodbye world :c, from: " .. component.instance.Name) 
    end
end)
```

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Each registered component gets a unique internal ID. Compo Inspector attaches this ID to the module so the runtime can track and manage it reliably.üîí **Don't modify or remove** this ID manually, or things might break.

### üí° Productivity Tip
Compo Inspector provides autocomplete support. Just type `:Component` inside a module, and ‚Äî voil√†! ‚Äî you‚Äôll instantly get a working component template to start with:

### üöÄ Launching
To start Compo, you need to initialize it separately in each realm (client/server):

```lua
-- client
local compo = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.compo)

-- launch() returns a promise that resolves when the main loop starts
compo.launch():andThen(function()
    print("Compo started!")
end)
```
Once launched, Compo will detect and activate all assigned components for that realm.

## Serialized Fields ü¶≠
One of the most powerful features of Compo is the ability to define custom, editable fields in your components ‚Äî just like Unity's serialized fields. These fields allow you to customize component behavior per instance.

### üí£ Defining Fields
To expose fields, pass a second argument to createComponent: a table describing the fields and their default values.

```lua
return Compo.createComponent(function(component)
  -- ...
, {
	number = Compo.fields.number(),
	string = Compo.fields.string(),
	boolean = Compo.fields.boolean(),
	vector3 = Compo.fields.vector3(),
	vector2 = Compo.fields.vector2()
})
```
When a field is exposed:
* It's stored as an attribute on the instance.
* The field's value can be accessed at runtime through `component.fields`.

### ‚úÖ Supported Types

| Type    | API                     | Default Value  |
| ------- | ------------------------| -------------- |
| String  | `Compo.fields.string()` | `""`           |
| Number  | `Compo.fields.number()` | `0`            |
| Boolean | `Compo.fields.boolean()`| `true`         |
| Vector3 | `Compo.fields.vector3()`| `Vector3.zero` |
| Vector2 | `Compo.fields.vector2()`| `Vector2.zero` |

You can customize the default value by passing it in. If no value is passed, the default one is used.

> All data is safely stored as attributes with a special naming format that Compo parses at runtime.

## Life Cycle

<p align="center"><img alt="Download plugin badge" src="assets/lifeCycleDiagram.png" height=800/> </p>
The Compo runtime follows a structured lifecycle for every component, giving you hooks to run logic at different phases:


| Phase           | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `awake()`       | Called as soon as the scheduler detects and loads the component. Can yield.                                                                                              |
| `onEnable()`    | Called after `awake()`. Runs once when the component is first enabled, and again if re-enabled later. Can yield.                                                         |
| `start()`       | Called **only after all components in the realm have completed their `awake()` and `onEnable()`**. This guarantees that everything is initialized before `start()` runs. |
| `update()`      | Called every frame on `RunService.Heartbeat`.                                                                                                                            |
| `fixedUpdate()` | Called at a fixed interval (default: 0.02s), independent of frame rate.                                                                                                  |
| `onDisable()`   | Called when the component is disabled or the instance is removed.                                                                                                        |
| `onDestroy()`   | Called when the component is permanently unregistered or destroyed.                                                                                                      |
> [!NOTE]
> When a component yields in awake() or onEnable(), it delays the entire lifecycle ‚Äî meaning no component will run start() until all components have completed both phases.
